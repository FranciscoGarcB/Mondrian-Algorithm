## Overview
This repository contains implementations of the Mondrian Algorithm, a method for partitioning data in a way that is particularly useful for various analytical purposes. The repository showcases two main versions of the algorithm: one using random data and the other applying it to a specific dataset, ocd_patient_dataset.csv.

## Files in the Repository
Jupyter Notebooks
Mondrian_with_Random_Data.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the Mondrian Algorithm using randomly generated data. It serves as a practical guide to understand the algorithm's behavior in a controlled environment.

Mondrian_with_OCD_Patient_Data.ipynb: This notebook applies the Mondrian Algorithm to the ocd_patient_dataset.csv. It is tailored to show how the algorithm can be used with real-world data, providing insights into its application in practical scenarios.

## Data
ocd_patient_dataset.csv: The dataset used in the Mondrian_with_OCD_Patient_Data.ipynb notebook. This dataset contains structured information relevant to the demonstration of the algorithm in a real-world context.
