## Overview
This repository contains implementations of the Mondrian Algorithm, a method for partitioning data in a way that is particularly useful for various analytical purposes. The repository showcases two main versions of the algorithm: one using random data and the other applying it to a specific dataset, ocd_patient_dataset.csv.

## Files in the Repository
Jupyter Notebooks
[AnonymizeGeneral.ipynb](AnonymizeGeneral.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the Mondrian Algorithm using randomly generated attributes (Age and Salary). It serves as a practical guide to understand the algorithm's behavior in a controlled environment.

[AnonymizeDataset.ipynb](AnonymizeDataset.ipynb): This notebook applies the Mondrian Algorithm to the Bank_Personal_Loan.csv. It is used to show how the algorithm can be used with real-world data, providing insights into its application in practical scenarios.

## Data
[Bank_Personal_Loan.csv](Bank_Personal_Loan.csv): The dataset used in the AnonymizeDataset.ipynb notebook. This dataset contains structured information relevant to the demonstration of the algorithm in a real-world context. It was modified ([BankData.csv](BankData.csv)) to exclude non-sense values.
